                <p>The cat is a super cute pet. It is loyal, humble, easily trainable and easily maintainable pet. Children love to play with cats.
                    I have a pet cat. It’s name is Winkie. It’s white and grey in color. It has lovely green eyes. It is very soft and furry.
                 It eats fish and drinks milk. It plays with me when I come back from school. It likes to play with ball in the garden. It loves me and shows it’s love by licking me when I come back from school.  It sleeps in a small basket near my bed. I love my pet very much and take care of it.
